      Note on checkout link: it is a good idea to avoid linking to /checkout directly because shops that use
      Paypal Express Checkout and/or Google Checkout have special checkout buttons on the /cart page. Also,
      special instructions for the seller are entered on the /cart page. Finally, the universal tracking code
      of Google Analytics may not work if linking directly to the /checkout page.

    <a href="/cart">{{ cart.item_count }} {{ cart.item_count | pluralize: 'item', 'items' }} ({{ cart.total_price | money }})</a>

    {% if shop.customer_accounts_enabled %}
      {% if customer %}
        Logged in as <a href="/account">{{ customer.first_name }}</a> Â· {{ 'Log out' | customer_logout_link }}
      {% else %}
        {{ 'Log in' | customer_login_link }}
        {% if shop.customer_accounts_optional %}
        or {{ 'Create an account' | customer_register_link }}
        {% endif %}

      It would be nice if the logo was a shop setting, rather than a theme setting.
      But for now, it is a theme setting. The shop logo is uploaded on the theme settings page.
      Link to the theme settings page of currently published theme will always be:
      http://www.shopify.com/admin/themes/current/settings.
      To add theme settings to a theme, see this: http://docs.shopify.com/themes/theme-templates/settings
      Theme settings are added to http://www.shopify.com/admin/themes/current#config/settings.html
