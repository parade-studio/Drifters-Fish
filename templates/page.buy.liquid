        <p>The cold pristine waters of the Copper River provide us with sustainable, healthy salmon that we are excited to share with you. We harvest our salmon using the process of gillnetting. This involves laying a net wall in the water along the fishesâ€™ path. The fish swim into the mesh and are prevented from escaping when their gills are caught in the web. The fish are then bled and kept in slush ice water until we process and pack your Wild Salmon Share.</p>
